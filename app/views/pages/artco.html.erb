    <p>Art Co has been started during a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon, Melbourne (bath#680). <br>
    I was the Project Manager of this product working with a team of 4. <br>
    The project was presented during the demo day in September 2021.

    <p>The landing page was designed to help the user understanding the concept really quickly. Our two main users as venue owners and artists.</p>

    <p>The artists can upload thier collections and artworks really easily on the website.</p>

    <p>The venue owners can add their venues and create exhibitions. By creating an expo, they sent an invitation to all the artists. If they are interested, they can send their collections to the venues owner who will chose the ones he prefers.</p>
