    <p>Art Co was created during a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon, Melbourne (bath#680). <br>
    I was the Project Manager of this product working with a team of 4. <br>
    We worked together during 2 weeks. <br>
    The project was presented during the demo day in September 2021. <br>
    We were 12 students during the bootcamp. Here is a picture of 5 of us.

    <br>
    <p>The landing page was designed to help the user understanding the concept really quickly. <br>
    Our two main users are venue owners and artists.</p>

    <p>The artists can upload thier collections and artworks really easily on the website.</p>

    <p>The venue owners can add their venues and create exhibitions. <br>
     By creating an expo, they sent an invitation to all the artists. <br>
      If they are interested, they can apply to this expo by sending their collections to the venue owner who will chose the ones he prefers.</p>
